We share the results of our research (but protect the data of our partners and collaborators). There are great opportunities to make wine and food supply chains lean. This concept is associated with the world of manufacturing, where it was introduced by Toyota. But some of the same issues apply to supply chains, though in new and sometimes unexpected ways.\nThe issues on which we focus are:\nElimination of waste This includes double-handling, such as moving wine among tanks, repacking bottles, repalletising cartons.\nManagement of variability Process time variability means downstream customers must endure occasional stock-outs or else protect themselves with extra inventory, an additional expense. Temperature variability damages wine by creating piston-like movements of the cork, which admits oxygen to the bottle.\nSynchronisation and alignment All participants in the supply chain must coordinate to match production with consumption. But wine production requires long lead times and depends on unforeseeable factors such as weather.\nFurthermore, many of the markets for alcohol are regulated in complex and arbitrary ways. Such factors create dilemmas all along the supply chain. For example, should the winery make-to-stock or make-to-order? Or should it produce unlabeled bottles for later customization? How can internet sales be facilitated? What will be the role of the distributor if the 3-tier system of distribution, now common in the US, is dismantled?\nContinuous improvement There must be processes in place to constantly review and evaluate supply chain performance as a whole, and not just the independent enterprises along the chain. And the supply chain must look ahead to new challenges, such as carbon-based costs, or a reorganization of the current 3-tier distribution system in the World.\nPartners:\nCouncil for Scientific and Industrial Research, South Africa\nCommonwealth and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia\nPontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Chile\nSupply Chain and Logistics Institute, Georgia Tech, USA\nUniversità di Bologna, Italy\nUniversidad Nacional de Cuyo, Argentina\nEvery two years we organize the international conference on wine and food, which had its last event at the University of Bologna after the pandemic.We eagerly hope to see you in Mendoza in October 2024\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nWelcome to Mendoza\nThe City of Mendoza is the most important in the region of Cuyo. Famous for lodging Mount Aconcagua, for its Malbec wines and for being the cradle of the heroic deeds of Liberator General San Martín, Father of this nation, it is one of the most beautiful and neat cities in the country.\nMendoza CapitalAccommodation venues represent another reason for the city to feel proud. It manages to combine traditional lodgings with new accommodation trends at boutique wineries, an increasingly popular option for visitors.\nTipica acequia de MendozaCapital of the province bearing the same name, Mendoza, and nestled in the foothills of the Andes Mountain Range, it gives shape to an incredible oasis created by man with the help of the Mendoza and Tunuyán Rivers, which have been wisely channeled into a huge irrigation system that gives life to everything it touches.\nThe climate in Mendoza is moderate-temperate, though its mountains provide a certain degree of aridity. Summer temperatures range between 18 and 36 C°; days are very hot and nights are fresh. In Mendoza in winter, the ski season, minimum temperatures drop to -2 C° whereas maximums hit 16 C°.\nThe City of Mendoza may be accessed either by air, landing at its international airport called Francisco Gabrielli - El Plumerillo, or by land through National Routes 7 and 40.\nSightseeing tours show visitors the history and culture of its dwellers, which may also be appreciated in its museums, its cafés, squares, institutions and public buildings. Owner of a historical tradition, Mendoza preserves countless memories from the times of San Martin’s ordeal through Mount De la Gloria, el Plumerillo, San Martín Park and a variety of museums whose treasures document the passing of the Argentinian hero through this region.\nBut also nature rules in this city that serves as a starting point for all kinds of adventure activities and high country sports, such as mountaineering, climbing and ski, as well as river rafting, which is practiced in the Mendoza River, with some very difficult stretches highly praised by the best sportsmen in the world.\nThe Wine Route is another ancient and renovated attraction in town. Visitors may go around several wineries tasting the wines produced at those venues and which have made this region famous worldwide.\nNo wonder the slogan “the land of good sunshine and good wine” remains intact, more accurate than ever.\n\n\n\n",
